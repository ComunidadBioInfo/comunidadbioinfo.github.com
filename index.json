R: know how to install packages RStudio: know how to use.  Technical requirements\n Personal computer. Minimum 8GB RAM, a mouse and sufficient disk space for text files and image files. Administrator privileges to install and run utilities such as RStudio.  Overview In recent years, R has become one of the most used programming languages for data science. The explosion in data available in many fields has increased the demand for data analysts, which is the case in Bioinformatics. R users start by learning how to use the tools others have openly shared with the international community. These R users acquire skills as they continue to analyze data and might even start to interact with R software developers through community websites such as RStudio Community, Bioconductor Support or via Twitter using the #rstats hashtag. Eventually some R users will want to write their own functions and share them online with others. They can do so via creating their own R packages and sharing them via repositories likes CRAN and Bioconductor or simply via GitHub. In this workshop participants will work through the Building Tidy Tools rstudio::conf 2019 workshop and then build their own R packages by collaborating with each other, similar to what was done at rOpenSci unconf18.\nThis workshop is aimed at students and researchers interested in data analysis that have experience using R. We encourage applications from experts in diverse disciplines, including but not limited to biologists, bioinformaticians, data scientists, software engineers and programmers and R users at large. The main goals of the workshop are:\n  Teach participants the principles of reproducible data science through the development of R/Bioconductor packages.\n  Turn (bioinformatics) software users into (bioinformatics) software developers.\n  Foster the exchange of expertise and establish multidisciplinary collaborations.\n  Create a community of Latin American scientists committed to the development of software and computational pipelines for (biological) data analysis.\n  Help train users that can become local instructors and continue to grow their local communities.\n  This workshop is part of a long-term project to create a community of developers from Latin America. We hope to hold regular meetings in the future (similar to BioC, EuroBioc and BioCAsia) where attendees present their own software contributions.

They have kindly shared their materials with us, which we will translate to Spanish.\n This is a two-day hands on workshop for those who have embraced the tidyverse and now want to expand it to meet their own needs. We\u0026rsquo;ll discuss API design, functional programming tools, the basics of object design in S3, and the tidy eval system for NSE.\nLearn efficient workflows for developing high-quality R functions, using the set of conventions codified by a package. You\u0026rsquo;ll also learn workflows for unit testing, which helps ensure that your functions do exactly what you think they do. Master the art of writing functions that do one thing well and can be fluently combined together to solve more complex problems.We\u0026rsquo;ll cover common function writing pitfalls and how to avoid them.\nLearn how to write collections of functions that work well together, and adhere to existing conventions so they\u0026rsquo;re easy to pick up for newcomers.\nYou should take this workshop if you have experience programming in R and want to learn how to tackle larger scale problems. You\u0026rsquo;ll get the most from it if you\u0026rsquo;re already familiar with functions and are comfortable with R‚Äôs basic data structures (vectors, matrices, arrays, lists, and data frames).\n Instead of two days, we will teach this workshop in two and a half days such that we can give you more time to digest the material and work through an introduction to Git and GitHub.\nCDSB runconf R unconference events (runconf) typically involve two stages and an optional third one. First, participants create issues weeks ahead of the runconf where they share ideas that they can work through in collaboration with others during the two days of the runconf. In the second stage, participants meet each other and get to know each other through some icebreakers. They then work together for two days on the projects that received the most votes. This is where participants get to learn skills from each other and get a taste of developing open source software in a collaborative environment. At the end, everyone shares their work with the whole group. In the third and final stage, runconf attendees might continue to interact with each other to further polish the packages they worked on during the runconf event, start new collaborations and/or write blog posts about their experience.\nThere are many blog posts about rOpenSci unconf events. A recent runconf was the chirunconf which you can read more about on this blog post by Sharla Gelfand.\nIf you are attending our workshop, we will ask you to propose at least one R package idea by creating a GitHub Issue in our GitHub repository for the workshop. If you want some inspiration, take a look at rOpenSci unconf18\u0026lsquo;s GitHub repository. You will need to get familiarized with all the proposal before the workshop starts.\nInstructors:    Alejandra Medina-Rivera (International Laboratory for Human Genome Research, Juriquilla, Mexico)\n   Alejandro Reyes (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, USA)\n   Leonardo Collado-Torres (Lieber Institute for Brain Development, Baltimore, USA).

The workshop itself was a success as described in our summary post about the event. However, we didn‚Äôt want to stop there. We formed CDSB and teamed up with TIB (‚ÄúTalleres Internacionales de Bioinform√°tica‚Äù) from NNB-UNAM with the goal of simulating the BioC yearly meeting where attendees can learn R, mature as R users and become R developers. We also organized this workshop because we want to see more Latin Americans at BioC.\nBioC2019 application process Time passed since our 2018 workshop as everyone continued on their regular jobs and training programs. BioC2019 was then announced and with it were announced the application guidelines for:\n Presenting a talk or poster Applying for a travel award Proposing a workshop  Basically, those applying for a travel award had to:\n Create a website or upload their CV to a publicly available website Answer in about 150 words or less How have you participated in the Bioconductor project in the past? Answer in about 150 words or less What do you hope to get out of the conference? Write a scientific abstract of 300 words or less for the talk/poster proposal^[Or propose a workshop, but that‚Äôs too much to ask from those just starting their BioC journeys. It‚Äôs more appropriate for BioC veterans.].  The whole process, while designed to be welcoming, can be a bit daunting if this is your first time applying and if English is not your native language. Thus, when we reminded our community members about BioC2019 we offered our help for this application process.\nHelping CDSB members Given their experience with Bioconductor, Alejandro Reyes and Leonardo Collado Torres volunteer to help CDSB members. The reminder blog post and individually contacting some CDSBMexico 2018 attendees helped find and motivate members to apply. Simply encouraging them and telling them that they had a realistic chance made a big difference, that is, believing in them and the work that we‚Äôve done already as a community. There were many emails, Slack message channels and documents shared, but ultimately the clean version of the process was the following.\n A CSDB member expressed interest in BioC2019 to a CDSB volunteer (Alejandro or Leonardo). A CSDB volunteer reminded them of the BioC2019 application process and clarified any rule questions they had. If appropriate, the CDSB volunteer also explained some options for creating websites hosted on GitHub. The CDSB member wrote their draft answers to the two questions, plus their draft abstract, in a Google Doc that they shared with the CDSB volunteers with edit permissions. Similarly, the CDSB member created a draft website. All CDSB volunteers provided suggestions on how to present their information more clearly to the application reviewers keeping in mind what the CDSB member wanted to express about themselves or their work. The CDSB member made modifications and if appropriate asked for another round of feedback.  Basically, the CDSB volunteers passed on the best practices they know for filling out these applications and writing abstracts, including here some timely advice from Wolfgang Huber ( a longtime Bioconductor Project contributor).\nThe generic paper abstract\n1. Why is it important? (1)\n2. What is \u0026quot;it\u0026quot;? (1)\n3. But what is the problem with it? (1)\n4. What did you do about the problem? (1)\n5. What was your result? (n)\n6. What are some wider implications? (1)\n(in parentheses: number of sentences)\n\u0026mdash; Wolfgang Huber (@wolfgangkhuber) February 22, 2019  The end result In the end, three CDSB members went through the whole process and created their websites:\n  Ana Beatriz Villase√±or-Altamirano  C√©sar Miguel Valdez C√≥rdova  Joselyn Chavez  They all submitted their applications for the BioC2019 travel award before the deadline expired on March 15th 2019, something that we emphasized they should do!\nA couple of weeks passed, and on April 2nd we were delighted to report that all three of them got 10 minute talks üéôand travel awards ‚úàÔ∏èapproved. This is an enormous win for CDSB and a huge morale boost üéâü•≥.\nThank you @Bioconductor!! Today 4 of our members got travel scholarships, talks and workshops approved. 6 total will attend #bioc2019 Please welcome them!@AnaBetty2304 @josschavezf1 @cmvaldezcordova @doctor_calvo @areyesq @fellgernon#rstats #diversityhttps://t.co/apxYxSpE5Z pic.twitter.com/tmSYbZvi7B\n\u0026mdash; ComunidadBioInfo (@CDSBMexico) April 3, 2019  We cannot hide our excitement about these news and are looking forward to seeing them at BioC2019! We hope that all of them will have a great experience üôåüèΩüòÉ\nA word from our CDSB members going to BioC2019 Like we‚Äôve said, this is just the beginning and we want to keep helping others in years to come. We thus asked Ana, C√©sar and Joselyn to share a few words to future CDSB members on the BioC2019 travel award application process and the feedback they got from CDSB volunteers.\nAna  The application process for BioC2019 and the travel award is not so difficult at the end but when I read the requirements for the first time I was overwhelmed, I had never published a web page before and I needed it to cover one of the requirements that asked for a personal website or public CV! It crossed my mind that I would not apply but Leo and Alejandro cheered me up, supported and guided me to create my own website (now I do webpages in R for anything that I can, hehe). They also helped me with the remaining requirements and at the end, I was able to enjoy the application process, I truly appreciate all the assistance they provided me and I can‚Äôt wait to meet them in NY. Without a doubt, Leo and Alejandro are accessible and inspiring bioinformaticians and people, as a consequence CDSB is a friendly and engaged community with the aim to impulse Mexican bioinformatic development to the world.\n C√©sar  When I attended CDSB Mexico 2018, the last thing I imagined was that the process would culminate in me receiving a travel scholarship for BioC2019; Impostor syndrome is absolutely real. When talking about my master‚Äôs thesis with both Alejandro and Leo, they encouraged me to go all the way with its code and try and make a contribution to the Bioconductor project in the process. Said task seemed insurmountable in the beginning. However, after attending CDSB Mexico 2018, my perspective changed significantly. A deciding factor in me taking the plunge to actually go through with the contribution and consequent conference application was the overwhelmingly constructive support I received from the community at every stage in the process, from my original idea, all the way up to the conference‚Äôs application. Along the process, I noticed that even when we often expect to have an absolutely perfect product (a personal webpage, an online CV or an r package and all that it entails) from the get-go, this is rarely the way in which things happen. Clich√© as it may sound, Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day. Being able to shift my mindset and recognize the incremental nature of contributing has definitely set a precedent for how i‚Äôll be handling most career oriented endeavors from now on; hopefully with continued contributions to the Bioconductor project and the open-source domain! If there‚Äôs anything I have to say to future applicants and CDSB members is just that: Do it! Reach out! Apply while embracing the community that‚Äôs there for you! With a little luck and elbow grease, things might just go your way, as they did for me.\n Joselyn  When Alejandro Reyes and Leonardo Collado told me about applying to BioC2019 I felt nervous. I did not consider to submit my work and even less to apply for a scholarship before receiving their e-mail. They gave me all their trust and support through the process. Now I have been elected and feel very excited with this huge opportunity. I realize how warm the CDSBMexico community can be and that is possible to be part of meetings like BioC2019, all you have to do is let go of the fear to do it.\n ","date":1554418247,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554418247,"objectID":"784b67641b4e5219388330c21faded47","permalink":"/post/path-from-cdsbmexico-2018-to-bioc2019/","publishdate":"2019-04-04T22:50:47Z","relpermalink":"/post/path-from-cdsbmexico-2018-to-bioc2019/","section":"post","summary":"Last year the Community of Bioinformatics Software Developers (CDSB in Spanish) organized a one week workshop designed to train R users how to write R packages and ideally contribute them to Bioconductor.

The National Bioinformatics Node ( NNB-UNAM in Spanish) has organized workshops in bioinformatics and R since 2006 and more frequently since 2010. Last year, 2018, there were five simultaneous one week workshops:\n  Introduction to R and RStudio\n  Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of biological data with R\n  EDA of RNA-seq data and differential expression studies\n  Genome assembly and annotation from high-throughput sequencing data\n  And our Latin American R/Bioconductor Developers Workshop\n  Overall it was a success as described in A recap of CDSB 2018: the start of a community. However, we are not done yet! üí™üèΩAs we have stated several times, our goal is to turn R users into developers and to increase the representation of Mexicans and Latin Americans at other R events.\nBioC2019 The one R event that we followed as a guide last year is the Bioconductor yearly meeting, or BioC. This year, BioC2019 will be held during June 24 to 27 at New York City in the United States. If you are an academic the registration fee is 300 USD prior to May 24th. As of today (Feb 28th), a round trip from Mexico City on June 23 to 28th is about 320-410 USD1. The accommodation options listed start at 118 USD plus tax a night. As you can see, these numbers add up fairly fast which is a limiting factor for scientists from Mexico (and Latin American in general) to attend BioC2019.\nTravel scholarships However, we want to remind you that there are travel scholarships available! And we, CDSB, want to help you! üôåüèΩ\nAll the details about the travel scholarship and different types of submission proposals are available on the BioC2019 website. But let us summarize the process for you.\n  You have to apply for either a talk, poster or workshop.\n  You need a professional website, GitHub profile or your CV to be available online.\n  You need to answer two questions:\n    How have you participated in the Bioconductor project in the past?\n  What do you hope to get out of the conference?\n  For a talk or poster proposal you have a maximum of 300 words while workshop proposals involve filling out a template.\nThis is quite a bit of work, but the payoff is immense! You will compete for the opportunity to travel basically for free: free registration and hotel, plus $500 for travel expenses. This can be a career changing opportunity as it was the case for L. Collado-Torres (see his keynote slides) and others.\nGet started on your scholarship application! We know that many of us have a tendency to do things at the last minute. However, we hope üôèüèΩ that you start your application materials as soon as you can. Remember that the deadline is March 15th and no exceptions are made.\nWebsite If you don‚Äôt have a professional website, we recommend that you make one following Emily Zabor‚Äôs tutorial. This is the tutorial that one of your fellow CDSBMexico 2018 attendees used to create his website: joseaia.github.io. Alternatively, check out the Chromebook Data Science: intro to R course (available for free if you can‚Äôt afford it) which includes a lesson that walks you through this process.\nBioconductor project participation Next, we know that each of you worked at least in one R package during CDSBMexico 2018 such as rGriffin (check the blog post). Maybe you even submitted your package to Bioconductor. At least, you met and interacted with longtime Bioconductor members such as Martin Morgan and Benilton Carvalho. Since then, you might have worked on other R packages, shiny applications, etc. You might have also answered questions on the Bioconductor support website, reported bugs or opened issues in existing packages, joined the developers mailing list, joined the Bioconductor Slack workspace, etc. Ultimately, you could potentially present a poster or give a talk about the package you worked on last summer, but you‚Äôll need to coordinate with your team members and/or lab principal investigator.\nBenefitting from BioC2019 As for what you hope to get out of the conference, well, we will remind you that BioC has different workshops that can help you advance your R skills and knowledge. Furthermore, there‚Äôll be scientific talks from excellent bioinformatics researchers. Then, once you return from the conference, you can spread the knowledge you acquired in a variety of ways: implementing it on your work, teaching at your local university or research institute, participating in the Bioconductor community (Slack, the support website, contributing an R package, etc), presenting at a local R meetup, and participating in other forums. You can also benefit personally from attending the conference by networking with other users and developers that will attend it. From it, you might start new collaborations, find about graduate school programs, find potential postdoc advisors, among other opportunities. Hey, you might help us out with future CDSBMexico events!\nCDSBMexico hands on help If you need help directly, please get in touch with us via the CDSBMexico Slack workspace. If you either don‚Äôt remember the Slack workspace or you couldn‚Äôt attend CDSBMexico 2018, please get in touch with us via Twitter at twitter.com/CDSBMexico.\nWe understand that not many will be able to attend BioC2019, so keep an eye open for CDSBMexico 2019!

The benefits of having Computational Biology and Biostatistics Departments are plenty: for example, experts can interact and work together on a specific problem, and researchers from other disciplines can easily find support and establish collaborations. The goal of CDSB is to create a virtual department where experts in Biostatistics and Computational Biology can discuss ideas and help each other across all stages of their careers.\nThe first event organized by CDSB, LatAmBioc2018 included talks where both participants and speakers could start a dialogue and motivate each other by showcasing their work. As keynote invited speakers we had Daniel Pi√±ero, who talked about population genetics of maize in Mexico; Alejandro Ponce-Mendoza, who showed elegant shiny apps to visualize ecological data along with maps; Teresa Ortiz, who talked about gender biases among R programmers; and Benilton Carvalho, who showed the development of personalized medicine in Brazil.\nWe are having a great presentation from the founder of @RLadiesCDMX, @TeresaOM, about getting rid of gender biases among the #rstats community. #LatAmBioc18 @CDSBMexico #womeninSTEM pic.twitter.com/TPdDzHVdqC\n\u0026mdash; Alejandro Reyes (@areyesq) August 2, 2018  The LatAmBioc2018 poster session was designed to encourage interdisciplinary collaborations.

As scientists, we like our statements to be supported by data: the map below shows the affiliations, when available, of the contributors of the latest package submissions to the Bioconductor project. (These data were scraped using the Github API.) Although biases such as Mexican contributors with affiliations abroad might not have been considered, it is clear that only a few contributions come from Latin American countries.\nIn hopes of filling this gap, we gathered a diverse team of instructors, including Martin Morgan, Benilton Carvalho and Selene L. Fernandez-Valverde, who taught participants how to develop R/Bioconductor packages. The main idea was to turn Bioconductor software users into Bioconductor software developers.\nLet\u0026#39;s estimate Pi! Rcpp exercise! Rcpp sugar!

To celebrate the conclusion of the workshop, we had an improvised party in a bar that played Latin American music. As any good party should, it ended up quite late. Some of us went to bed at 4am, but we woke up energized to keep CSDB going.

We hope to continue developing Griffin and rGriffin (Martinez-Sanchez, Mu√±oz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018). If you have ideas, suggestions or bugs, please contact us via rGriffin GitHub repo.\n The problem Boolean networks allow us to give a mechanistic explanation to how cell types emerge from regulatory networks. However, inferring the regulatory network and its functions is complex problem, as the available information is often incomplete. rGriffin (Martinez-Sanchez, Mu√±oz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018) uses available biological information (regulatory interactions, cell types, mutants) codified as a set of restrictions and returns the Boolean Networks that satisfy that restrictions. This Boolean networks can then be used to study the biological system.\nThe rGriffin (Martinez-Sanchez, Mu√±oz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018) package is an R connector to Griffin (Gene Regulatory Interaction Formulator For Inquiring Networks), a java library for inference and analysis of Boolean Network models. Griffin takes as inputs biologically meaningful constraints and turns them into a symbolic representation. Using a SAT engine, Griffin explores the Boolean Network search space, finding all satisfying assignments that are compatible with the specified constraints. The rGriffin (Martinez-Sanchez, Mu√±oz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018) package includes a number of functions to interact with the BoolNet package.\n A small example Let us suppose a cell, we know that this cell has three proteins called a, b and c. We know that a activates b and that b and c inhibit each other. We also suspect that b and c may have positive self-regulatory loops. We can add this interactions to the table as ‚ÄúOPU‚Äù (optional, positive, unambiguous). This dataframe is the topology of the network.\n  Source Target Interaction    a b +  b c -  c b -  b b OPU  c c OPU    Suppose we also have some information of what cell types have been observed. For example, there is a cell type that expresses b, but not a or c and an other cell type that expresses c, but not a or b. There might exist a third cell type that has not been fully characterized where we know that the cell expresses no a or c but we have NO information on b. This dataframe is the attractors of the network.\n  a b c    0 1 0  0 0 1  0 * 0    We can then use this information to create a query. rGriffin (Martinez-Sanchez, Mu√±oz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018) can include other types of information like transition between cell type, cycles, transitions between cell types or mutant cell types.\n## Install using: # devtools::install_github(\u0026#39;mar-esther23/rgriffin\u0026#39;) ## Note that the package depends on rJava library(\u0026#39;rGriffin\u0026#39;) ## Loading required package: rJava genes = c(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;b\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;c\u0026#39;) inter = data.frame(source=c(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;b\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;c\u0026#39;), target=c(\u0026#39;b\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;), type=c(\u0026#39;+\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;-\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;-\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;OPU\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;OPU\u0026#39;), stringsAsFactors = F ) q = create.gquery.graph(inter, genes) attr = data.frame(a=c(0,\u0026#39;*\u0026#39;,0), b=c(0,1,0), c=c(0,0,1), stringsAsFactors = F ) q = add.gquery.attractors(q, attr) Then we can use Griffin to find the networks that behave according with our biological information.\nnets = run.gquery(q) nets ## [1] \u0026quot;targets,factors\\na,false\\nb,((((!a\u0026amp;b)\u0026amp;!c)|((a\u0026amp;!b)\u0026amp;!c))|((a\u0026amp;b)\u0026amp;!c))\\nc,(!b\u0026amp;c)\\n\u0026quot; ## [2] \u0026quot;targets,factors\\na,false\\nb,(((((!a\u0026amp;b)\u0026amp;!c)|((a\u0026amp;!b)\u0026amp;!c))|((a\u0026amp;b)\u0026amp;!c))|((a\u0026amp;b)\u0026amp;c))\\nc,(!b\u0026amp;c)\\n\u0026quot; ## [3] \u0026quot;targets,factors\\na,false\\nb,((((((!a\u0026amp;b)\u0026amp;!c)|((!a\u0026amp;b)\u0026amp;c))|((a\u0026amp;!b)\u0026amp;!c))|((a\u0026amp;b)\u0026amp;!c))|((a\u0026amp;b)\u0026amp;c))\\nc,(!b\u0026amp;c)\\n\u0026quot; ## [4] \u0026quot;targets,factors\\na,false\\nb,((((!a\u0026amp;b)\u0026amp;!c)|((a\u0026amp;b)\u0026amp;!c))|((a\u0026amp;b)\u0026amp;c))\\nc,(!b\u0026amp;c)\\n\u0026quot; ## [5] \u0026quot;targets,factors\\na,false\\nb,((((((!a\u0026amp;b)\u0026amp;!c)|((a\u0026amp;!b)\u0026amp;!c))|((a\u0026amp;!b)\u0026amp;c))|((a\u0026amp;b)\u0026amp;!c))|((a\u0026amp;b)\u0026amp;c))\\nc,(!b\u0026amp;c)\\n\u0026quot; There are multiple options to integrate BoolNet and rGriffin (Martinez-Sanchez, Mu√±oz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018). The function get.net.topology() can obtain the topology with interaction signs of a BoolNet network. The function attractor2dataframe() can be used to export a BoolNet attractor as a dataframe that rGriffin (Martinez-Sanchez, Mu√±oz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018) can use. The function run.gquery() includes the option return=‚ÄôBoolNet‚Äô, that return the inferred networks as BoolNet networks.\n History The development of Griffin began in 2013 as a PAPIIT (Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigaci√≥n e Innovaci√≥n Tecnol√≥gica) project to solve the inference of Boolean Network models for the Arabidopsis thaliana root stem cell niche. It continued in 2015 with support of Conacyt grant 221341.\nIn January, 2017 we organized a course in C3-UNAM to teach biologist how to use Griffin. We received two main comments: the input format was too complicated and it was uncomfortable to use the output with other packages. After some consideration we decided to create an R wrapper that could export and import BoolNet networks. We selected BoolNet as it has an good documentation and the package BoolFilter had been designed to work with it.\nThe development of rGriffin (Martinez-Sanchez, Mu√±oz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018) began during the EOBM 2017 in CUIB. For the following year we continued developing rGriffin (Martinez-Sanchez, Mu√±oz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018) as our schedules allowed. There were multiple challenges during the development: defining user-friendly inputs, using Rjava, and structuring the package. In August 2018, we attended the TIB2018-BCDW where we received valuable guidance from Martin Morgan and Benilton S Carvalho. It was during this workshop that the first version of rGriffin (Martinez-Sanchez, Mu√±oz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018) was finished.\n Acknowledgments Here you can find the tweet about the original blog post:\nCheck our first contributed blog post: R Gene Regulatory Interaction Formulator For Inquiring Networkshttps://t.co/9azbElGZGH\nME Martinez-Sanchez, S Mu√±oz, M Carrillo, E Azpeitia, D Rosenblueth\nThx @mt_morgan @benilton!#CDSBMexico #TIB2018 #LatAmBioc18 #rstats #TIB #blog pic.twitter.com/TbJv37fkWQ\n\u0026mdash; ComunidadBioInfo (@CDSBMexico) August 21, 2018  This blog post was made possible thanks to:\n blogdown (Xie, Hill, and Thomas, 2017) devtools (Wickham, Hester, and Chang, 2018) knitcitations (Boettiger, 2017) rGriffin (Martinez-Sanchez, Mu√±oz, Carrillo, Azpeitia, et al., 2018)   References  [1] C.

Introduction In recent years, biology has seen a rise in the use of technologies that enable high-throughput, quantitative, data-rich profiling of cellular states. As a result, the field now faces computational challenges to analyze such data. The R/ Bioconductor project is an open source, open development software platform that provides tools to translate complex data sets into biological knowledge.\nThis workshop is aimed at students and researchers interested in the analysis of biological data. We encourage applications from experts in diverse disciplines, including but not limited to biologists, bioinformaticians, data scientists, software engineers and programmers and R users at large. The main goals of the workshop are:\n  Teach participants the principles of reproducible data science through the development of R/Bioconductor packages.\n  Turn bioinformatics software users into bioinformatics software developers.\n  Foster the exchange of expertise and establish multidisciplinary collaborations.\n  Create a community of Latin American scientists committed to the development of software and computational pipelines for biological data analysis.\n  Help train bioinformatics instructors that can continue to grow in their local communities.\n  This workshop is part of a long-term project to create a community of developers from Latin America. We hope to hold regular meetings in the future (similar to BioC, EuroBioc and BioCAsia) where attendees present their own software contributions.

Su relaci√≥n se inicia debido al constante impulso del hombre por saber de qu√© estamos hechos, y fue por all√° de 1956 con la secuenciaci√≥n de la primera prote√≠na por Margaret O. Dayhoff.¬†A partir de entonces, con la constante producci√≥n de informaci√≥n biol√≥gica, la cual crec√≠a a un ritmo lento comparado con el actual volumen de generaci√≥n de datos, se cre√≥ la necesidad de recopilar y organizar toda la informaci√≥n generada a partir de dichos proyectos de secuenciaci√≥n, surgiendo as√≠, la primera base de datos con informaci√≥n biol√≥gica llamada Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Ben√≠tez P√°ez A, C√°rdenas Brino S, 2010).\nEsa relaci√≥n incipiente de las ciencias de la vida con las ciencias de la computaci√≥n ha dado origen a una disciplina que ha cobrado vida en los √∫ltimos a√±os: la bioinform√°tica.\nLos mayores avances en la bioinform√°tica acontecieron en a√±os posteriores a la creaci√≥n de la primera base de datos, y fue con la generaci√≥n de algoritmos matem√°ticos para el an√°lisis de secuencias, as√≠ como tambi√©n, la creaci√≥n y el impuso dado a las bases de datos y herramientas para el an√°lisis de secuencias con un impacto a nivel global.\nAdem√°s, con la creaci√≥n del consorcio para la ejecuci√≥n del proyecto de secuenciaci√≥n del genoma humano (Human Genome, HUGO), en 1993, se inici√≥ la era gen√≥mica. Siendo la decodificaci√≥n del genoma humano un proyecto tan ambicioso, que otros consorcios se crearon con el fin de secuenciar los primeros genomas no virales. En 1996, S. cerevisiae fue el primer genoma eucariota secuenciado. En 1995 y 1997, respectivamente, los genomas de Haemophilus influenzae y Escherichia coli fueron los primeros genomas bacterianos publicados. Entre los a√±os 1998 y 2000, se tuvieron los genomas secuenciados de Caenorhabditis elegans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Drosophila melanogaster y Arabidopsis thaliana. En el a√±o 2003, se finaliz√≥ la secuencia definitiva del genoma humano y, este hecho se logr√≥ gracias a la proyecci√≥n y explotaci√≥n del potencial de la industria biotecnol√≥gica.\nComo consecuencia, todos los avances tecnol√≥gicos destinados al campo de la gen√≥mica lograron proyectar a la comunidad cient√≠fica hacia la secuenciaci√≥n del genoma de cualquier organismo de inter√©s cient√≠fico o econ√≥mico. Hoy en d√≠a, existen m√°s de 12,574 genomas de bacterias completamente secuenciados y m√°s de 65,142 proyectos en curso (GOLD Database, https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/index release v.6).\nLa gran cantidad de informaci√≥n generada a partir de los m√∫ltiples proyectos de secuenciaci√≥n hizo que las bases de datos crecieran a un ritmo acelerado y casi insostenible. Al mismo tiempo, el enorme volumen de datos conlleva a que el n√∫mero de herramientas de an√°lisis y algoritmos computacionales surjan al mismo ritmo para poder extraer un conocimiento tangible que permita dar un¬†significado a la diversidad biol√≥gica de nuestro ecosistema.\n","date":1520369358,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520369358,"objectID":"17187444b10eb1a3aab48aaa15a15cd1","permalink":"/post/la-bioinformatica-una-disciplina-en-auge-en-el-mundo/","publishdate":"2018-03-06T20:49:18Z","relpermalink":"/post/la-bioinformatica-una-disciplina-en-auge-en-el-mundo/","section":"post","summary":"La Bioinform√°tica es un √°rea interdisciplinaria en la que convergen las tecnolog√≠as de la informaci√≥n y las comunicaciones con las ciencias de la vida, donde los recursos computacionales y humanos asisten al an√°lisis de cantidades enormes de datos biol√≥gicos, para extraer de ellos informaci√≥n valiosa y obtener resultados con impactos beneficiosos en la salud humana o animal (Gonz√°lez Hern√°ndez D**., 2007).**\nDesde la segunda mitad del siglo XX, la biolog√≠a ha tenido una relaci√≥n creciente con las ciencias de la informaci√≥n.","tags":null,"title":"Bioinformatics, a field on the rise in the world","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Community of Software Developers in Bioinformatics, stems from the concern for encouraging the participation and collaboration of people specializing in Bioinformatics and Genomics, to contribute or bring in free software development internationally.\nThe Community is convinced that, through courses, workshops, conferences, and other technological means, can strengthen the skills of its members to participate in development projects software, or undertake the development of new software quality, always promoting the spirit of cooperation and integration.\nWhat do we believe in ?\n Objectivity and neutrality: Members of the community, our colleagues deserve the truth and real knowledge, we do not allow ourselves to deceive them.
